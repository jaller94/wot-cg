## Liaisons to the W3C WoT Community Group

### Web of Things Interest and Working Group (Proposed)

> The part below until a horizontal line is written by the CG using inputs from the TPAC Joint Meeting, CG Internal Meeting and Office Hours inputs. Please scroll to [Original Input](#original-input)

The WoT IG/WG collaboration is categorized based on the type of collaboration. Below are the categories and the scope of the collaboration.

Note: WG/IG refers to both WoT Interest and Working Group. CG refers to the WoT CG.

#### Documents

If the CG wants to produce a document, it has to be a CG report covered by the [W3C CLA](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/).
This means that the CG does not contribute to WG or IG documents by editing them or doing Pull Requests directly. 
Related WG/IG documents can adopt the content from CG reports using Section 9 of the [W3C CLA](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/).
Any CG document category that is related to a WG/IG document category (e.g. use cases, bindings), MUST comply with the format and content requirements set by the WG/IG. 
If the CG decides to diverge from those requirements, the WG/IG MUST authorize this.
CG reports, as explained in the CG charter, can be in the form of Markdown, HTML, or similar. (TODO: Update CG Charter).

Examples of document categories that are related to WG/IG, which can be CG reports as explained above:

- Use cases
- Requirements
- Feature Proposals
- Bindings

#### Role of WoT CG

The role of the WoT CG in this collaboration is defined in two categories: enabling a low entry barrier and doing outreach.

##### Low entry barrier to be involved in WoT

Given that there are membership fees to participate in the CG, more participants be exchanging ideas on WoT-related topics.
More specifically, the WoT CG participants can:

- start WoT-related discussions within CG,
- work on CG reports that are non-normative,
- experiment with implementations and features of the WoT WG reports.

##### Outreach

The CG uses various channels administrated by the CG to reach a broad audience who is interested in WoT.
This also enables the low-entry barrier principle above.

#### Events

The WG/IG collaborates on Plugfest events with the CG, thus leveraging the community to get a wider audience.
WG/IG can collaborate with other CGs and liaisons as well.
There can be other WG/IG joint meetings with the CG, such as Face to Face, TPAC meetings.

#### Test Cases

CG participants CAN contribute to the testing activity of the WG/IG Task Forces.
The CG participants MUST contribute test cases to the CG GitHub repository.
Also, the inputs MUST comply with WG requirements on the quality, folder structure, file name conventions etc.
