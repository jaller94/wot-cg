## Liaisons to the W3C WoT Community Group

The liaisons of the W3C WoT CG are not explicitly outlined in the CG charter; however, they are documented in this document. 
This markdown document details each liaison and explains the extent of its scope.

Current liaisons:

- [Web of Things Interest and Working Group](#web-of-things-interest-and-working-group)

### Web of Things Interest and Working Group

> [!NOTE] 
> This is only a draft.

> The content below, until the horizontal line, is composed by the CG based on inputs from the TPAC Joint Meeting, CG Internal Meeting, and Office Hours inputs. Please refer to [Original Input](#original-input) for the discussion results form W3C TPAC 2023.

The WoT IG/WG liaison is categorized based on the nature of collaboration. 
The categories below explain the scope of collaboration.

Note: WG/IG collectively refers to both WoT Interest and Working Group, while CG pertains to the WoT CG.

#### Documents

If the CG intends to produce a document, it must adhere to the [W3C CLA](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/).
This mandates that the CG doesn't directly edit or open Pull Requests to change WG/IG documents.
Relevant WG/IG documents may incorporate content from CG reports following Section 9 of the [W3C CLA](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/).
Any CG document related to a WG/IG document type (e.g. use cases, bindings), MUST comply with the format and content requirements established by the WG/IG. 
Deviating from these requirements requires explicit authorization from the WG/IG.
CG reports, as explained by the CG charter, may take the form of Markdown, HTML, or similar formats (TODO: Update CG Charter).

Examples of document types pertinent to WG/IG, eligible as CG reports:

- Use cases
- Requirements
- Feature Proposals
- Bindings

#### Role of WoT CG

The role of the CG in this collaboration is categorized into two: facilitating a low entry barrier and engaging in outreach.

##### Facilitating a Low Entry Barrier for WoT Involvement

Considering the existence of membership fees for WG/IG participation, fostering more participants to exchange ideas on WoT-related topics becomes relevant.

CG participants can actively and openly exchange ideas on WoT-related topics within the CG, collaborate on non-normative CG reports, and experiment with the implementations of the WG/IG reports.

##### Outreach

The CG utilizes various channels under CG administration to reach a broad audience interested in WoT, aligning with the low-entry barrier principle.

#### Events

The WG/IG collaborates on Plugfest events with the CG, thereby leveraging the community to garner a wider audience. 
WG/IG may also engage in collaboration with other CGs and liaisons. 
Joint meetings, such as Face to Face (F2F) and TPAC meetings, may be convened between WG/IG and the CG.

#### Test Cases

CG participants are permitted to contribute to the testing activity of the WG/IG Task Forces. 
Contributions must adhere to WG requirements regarding quality, folder structure, file naming conventions, and other specifications.
The CG participants MUST contribute test cases to the CG GitHub repository.
